Description: extract stats from logs for collection in a timeseries database
 mtail is a tool for extracting metrics from application logs to be
 exported into a timeseries database or timeseries calculator for alerting
 and dashboarding.
 .
 It aims to fill a niche between applications that do not export their
 own internal state, and existing monitoring systems, without patching
 those applications or rewriting the same framework for custom extraction
 glue code.
 .
 Metrics are exported for scraping by a collector as JSON or Prometheus
 format over HTTP, or can be periodically sent to a collectd, StatsD,
 or Graphite collector socket.
 .
 See the Wiki (https://github.com/google/mtail/wiki/Home) for more details.
